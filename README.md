#pm2-nicehook

None of the existent webhook modules for PM2 were working for me, so I created this simple one. Feel free to use it if you want!
If you have any enchancements that you think can be done, feel free to send a Pull Request!

#Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/pedrofracassi/pm2-nicehook
cd pm2-nicehook
npm install
node index.js
```
You can also add it as a PM2 process, if you want to.
```
pm2 start index.js
```
